## üéØ Objectives
- **Predict Video Game Sales** 
Leverage machine learning algorithms to forecast global sales trends using historical video game data.

- **Identify Key Influencing Factors**
Determine which attributes (platform, genre, regional sales patterns) significantly impact game sales performance.

_**Optimize Model Performance**
Compare and tune multiple models to achieve the highest possible prediction accuracy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features
### 1. Data Processing & Cleaning
- Collected video game sales data (16,598 records) from Kaggle and VGChartz (1980‚Äì2020).
- Managed missing values via imputation and elimination.
- Encoded categorical variables with Label Encoding.
- Applied feature scaling for numerical stability.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized sales distributions, genre breakdowns, and platform sales trends using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- Assessed feature relationships with target variable (Global Sales) via correlation heatmaps.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Development
- Linear Regression: Baseline predictive model.
- Decision Tree: Non-linear model with hyperparameter tuning (max_depth, min_samples_split).
- Random Forest: Ensemble method with feature importance visualization.
- Gradient Boosting: Best performer with R¬≤ = 0.96 and MSE = 1.15.
- Performed cross-validation and GridSearchCV hyperparameter optimization for all models.

### 4. Model Comparison & Evaluation
- Evaluated models using MAE, MSE, and R¬≤ metrics.
- Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy.
- Generated residual plots and prediction vs. actual value graphs for performance assessment.
